in a time-domain finite-element homogenization technique for laminated iron cores. The separate 
discretization of each lamination is avoided by using dedicated skin-effect basis functions, which 
also serve to interpolate the J-A hysteretic material law. As validation test case, a stacked ring 
core surrounded by a toroidal coil is considered.},

abstract = {This paper presents the detailed implementation and computational aspects of a novel second-order computational homogenization procedure, which is suitable for a multi-scale modelling of macroscopic localization and size effects. The second-order scheme is an extension of the classical (first-order) computational homogenization framework and is based on a proper incorporation of the gradient of the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor into the kinematical macro--micro scale transition. From the microstructural analysis the macroscopic stress and higher-order stress tensors are obtained, thus delivering a microstructurally based constitutive response of the macroscopic second gradient con- tinuum. The higher-order macroscopic constitutive tangents are derived through static condensation of the microscopic global tangent matrix. For the solution of the second gradient equilibrium problem on the macrolevel a mixed finite element formulation is developed. As an example, the second-order computational homogenization approach is applied for the multi-scale analysis of simple shear of a constrained heterogeneous strip, where a pronounced boundary size effect appears.},

The macro method, defined on a macroscopic triangulation, aims at recovering the effective (homogenized) solution of an unknown macro model. The unspecified data of this model are computed by micro methods on sampling domains during the macro assembly process. In this Note, we show how to construct such a coupling with a discontinuous macro finite element space. We show that the flux information needed in this formulation in order to impose weak interelement continuity can be recovered from the known micro calculations on the sampling domains.

We propose a method which discretizes the physical problem directly by a macroscopic FEM, coupled with a microscopic FEM resolving the micro scale on small cells or patches. The assembly process of the unknown macroscopic model is done without iterative cycles. The method allows to recover the macroscopic properties of the material in an efficient and cheap way. The microscale behavior can be reconstructed from the known micro and macro solutions. We give a fully discrete convergence analysis for the proposed method which takes into account the discretization errors at both micro and macro levels. In the case of a periodic elastic tensor, we give a priori error estimates for the displacement and for the macro and micro strains and stresses as well as an error estimate for the numerical homogenized tensor.},

Mean fields per phase are generally used in homogenization and represent sufficient information in most cases. However, more information about the field distribution can be necessary, particularly in nonlinear cases. Then, intraphase fluctuations have to be determined. This paper presents a method, based on homogenization tools, for the determination of both estimates and bounds for the intraphase fluctuations. The presented applications deal with magnetic materials and the results obtained with homogenization are compared to those obtained using a finite element modeling.},

abstract = {Nanocomposites of polycaprolactone (PCL) filled with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were foamed by supercritical CO2 in order to prepare materials with reduced electromagnetic interference (EMI). Two mixing techniques were used, i.e., melt blending and co-precipitation. Shielding efficiency as high as 60 to 80 dB together with a low reflectivity was observed at a very low vol% of MWNTs (0.25 vol%). The reflectivity of the nanocomposites was advantageously decreased upon foaming. The uniformity of the open-cell structure was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. These foamed PCL/MWNT nanocomposites are very promising EMI shielding materials because their performances result from absorption at low filler content and not from reflection at relatively high filler content as was previously the case.},

title = {Optimal Design of Magnetostrictive Composites: An Analytical Approach},
abstract = {Giant magnetostriction materials, such as Terfenol-D, have allowed the development of a new class of actuators and sensors based on magnetoelastic properties. However, their mechanical properties are a limiting factor for some applications. Composites, made of Terfenol-D particles in a matrix, can bypass these limitations, improving the overall mechanical properties while maintaining the magnetostriction effect. But, to optimize the design of magnetostrictive composites, advanced modeling tools are needed. This paper proposes a homogenization model based on inclusion problems. It compares modeling results to experimental data from the literature, and it illustrates the use of the model as a tool for optimal design.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with a multiscale finite element method for numerically solving second-order scalar elliptic boundary value problems with highly oscillating coefficients. In the spirit of previous other works, our method is based on the coupling of a coarse global mesh and a fine local mesh, the latter being used for computing independently an adapted finite element basis for the coarse mesh. The main idea is the introduction of a composition rule, or change of variables, for the construction of this finite element basis. In particular, this allows for a simple treatment of high-order finite element methods. We provide optimal error estimates in the case of periodically oscillating coefficients. We illustrate our method in various examples.},

abstract = {This paper presents a two-scale thermo-mechanical analysis framework for heterogeneous solids based on a computational homogenization technique. The evolution of the mechanical and thermal fields at the macroscopic level is resolved through the incorporation of the microstructural response. Within the pro- posed multi-scale approach, the temperature dependent non-linear thermo-mechanical response is accounted by solving a boundary value problem at the micro-scale, the results of which are properly averaged and transferred to the macro level in a consistent way. The framework does not require explicitly determined homogenized material properties (e.g. macroscopic thermal expansion coefficients) since no constitutive equations are required for the macroscopic stresses and heat fluxes at the macro level. A nested finite element solution procedure with an operator-split implementation is outlined and the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by illustrative key examples.},

title = {Shape optimization by the homogenization method},
abstract = {In the context of shape optimization, we seek minimizers of the sum of the elastic compliance and of the weight of a solid structure under specified loading. This problem is known not to be well-posed, and a relaxed formulation is introduced. Its effect is to allow for microperforated composites as admissi- ble designs. In a two-dimensional setting the relaxed formulation was obtained in [6] with the help of the theory of homogenization and optimal bounds for composite materials. We generalize the result to the three dimensional case. Our contribution is twofold; first, we prove a relaxation theorem, valid in any dimen- sions; secondly, we introduce a new numerical algorithm for computing optimal designs, complemented with a penalization technique which permits to remove composite designs in the final shape. Since it places no assumption on the num- ber of holes cut within the domain, it can be seen as a topology optimization algorithm. Numerical results are presented for various two and three dimensional problems.},

The construction of the base functions is fully decoupled from element to element; thus the method is perfectly parallel and is naturally adapted to massively parallel computers.

abstract = {This paper is devoted to the homogenization of a heat conduction problem in a periodically perforated domain with a nonlinear and nonlocal boundary condition modeling radiative heat transfer in the perforations. Because of the critical scaling considered it is essential to use a method of two-scale asymptotic expansions inside the variational formulation of the problem. We obtain a nonlinear homogenized problem of heat conduction with effective coefficients which are computed via a cell problem featuring a radiative heat transfer boundary condition. We rigorously justify this homogenization process for the linearized problem by using two-scale convergence. We performnumerical simulations in two dimensions: we reconstruct an approximate temperature field by adding to the homogenized temperature a corrector term. The computed numerical errors agree with the theoretical predicted errors and prove the effectiveness of our method for multiscale simulation of conductive and radiative heat transfer problems in periodically perforated domains.},

The book begins by setting the theoretical foundations of the subject area, and moves on to develop a unified approach to the simplification of a wide range of problems which possess multiple scales, via perturbation expansions; differential equations and stochastic processes are studied in one unified framework. The book concludes with an overview of a range of theoretical tools used to justify the simplified models derived via the perturbation expansions.
The presentation of the material is particularly suited to the range of mathematicians, scientists and engineers who want to exploit multiscale methods in applications. Extensive use of examples shows how to apply multiscale methods to solving a variety of problems. Exercises then enable readers to build their own skills and put them into practice.
Extensions and generalizations of the results presented in the book, as well as references to the literature, are provided in the Discussion and Bibliography section at the end of each chapter. All of the twenty-one chapters are supplemented with exercises.

title = {The Periodic Unfolding Method in Homogenization},
abstract = {The periodic unfolding method was introduced in 2002 in [Cioranescu, Damlamian, and Griso, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. 1, 335 (2002), pp. 99--104] (with the basic proofs in [Proceedings of the Narvik Conference 2004, GAKUTO Internat. Ser. Math. Sci. Appl. 24, Gakkotosho, Tokyo, 2006, pp. 119--136]). In the present paper we go into all the details of the method and include complete proofs, as well as several new extensions and developments. This approach is based on two distinct ideas, each leading to a new ingredient. The first idea is the change of scale, which is embodied in the unfolding operator. At the expense of doubling the dimension, this allows one to use standard weak or strong convergence theorems in \{\$}L\^p\{\$} spaces instead of more complicated tools (such as two-scale convergence, which is shown to be merely the weak convergence of the unfolding; cf. Remark 2.15). The second idea is the separation of scales, which is implemented as a macro-micro decomposition of functions and is especially suited for the weakly convergent sequences of Sobolev spaces. In the framework of this method, the proofs of most periodic homogenization results are elementary. The unfolding is particularly well-suited for multiscale problems (a simple backward iteration argument suffices) and for precise corrector results without extra regularity on the data. A list of the papers where these ideas appeared, at least in some preliminary form, is given with a discussion of their content. We also give a list of papers published since the publication [Cioranescu, Damlamian, and Griso, C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. 1, 335 (2002), pp. 99--104], and where the unfolding method has been successfully applied.},

abstract = {The following general problem is discussed: given a composite, made from at least two different materials with each its own (scalar, and possibly complex- valued) \{\$}\backslash epsilon\{\$} and \{\$}\backslash mu\{\$}, distributed in space in a regular, crystal-like, pattern, find the equivalent permittivity and permeability (they will, in general, be tensors). A computation in which such repetitive composites are present can then be done by simply replacing these with their equivalent, homogenized, materials. When one does all this, it may come as a surprise to see ``cross-dependencies'': B, e.g., depends not only on H but on E as well, and D depends both on E and H. This kind of behavior, which is characteristic of the so-called chiral materials (because they rotate the polarization plane of waves), may result from homogenization, even with non-chiral components. Some symmetry arguments are used to find a necessary condition for this to happen: geometrical chirality at the cell level, that is, the cell should fail to be congruent with its image by central symmetry.},

abstract = {The recently introduced multiscale finite element method for solving elliptic equations with oscillating coefficients is designed to capture the large-scale structure of the solutions without resolving all the fine-scale structures. Motivated by the numerical simulation of flow transport in highly heterogeneous porous media, we propose a mixed multiscale finite element method with an over-sampling technique for solving second order elliptic equations with rapidly oscillating coefficients. The multiscale finite element bases are constructed by locally solving Neumann boundary value problems. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the method under the assumption that the oscillating coefficients are locally periodic. While such a simplifying assumption is not required by our method, it allows us to use homogenization theory to obtain the asymptotic structure of the solutions. Numerical experiments are carried out for flow transport in a porous medium with a random log-normal relative permeability to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

abstract = {We describe a multiscale finite element (FE) solver for elliptic or parabolic problems with highly oscillating coefficients. Based on recent developments of the so-called heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM), the algorithm relies on coupled macro- and microsolvers. The framework of the HMM allows to design a code whose structure follows the classical finite elements implementation at the macro level. To account for the fine scales of the problem, elementwise numerical integration is replaced by micro FE methods on sampling domains. We discuss a short and flexible FE implementation of the multiscale algorithm, which can accommodate simplicial or quadrilateral FE and various coupling conditions for the constrained micro simulations. Extensive numerical examples including three dimensional and time dependent problems are presented illustrating the efficiency and the versatility of the computational strategy.

abstract = {Heterogeneous multiscale methods have been introduced by E and Engquist [ Commun. Math. Sci., 1 ( 2003), pp. 87 - 132] as a methodology for the numerical computation of problems with multiple scales. Analyses of the methods for various homogenization problems have been done by several authors. These results were obtained under the assumption that the microscopic models ( the cell problems in the homogenization context) are analytically given. For numerical computations, these microscopic models have to be solved numerically. Therefore, it is important to analyze the error transmitted on the macroscale by discretizing the. ne scale. We give in this paper H-1 and L-2 a priori estimates of the fully discrete heterogeneous multiscale finite element method. Numerical experiments confirm that the obtained a priori estimates are sharp.},

title = {Computational plasticity for composite structures based on mathematical homogenization: Theory and practice},
abstract = {This paper generalizes the classical mathematical homogenization theory for heterogeneous medium to account for eigenstrains. Starting from the double scale asymptotic expansion for the displacement and eigenstrain fields we derive a close form expression relating arbitrary eigenstrains to the mechanical fields in the phases. The overall structural response is computed using an averaging scheme by which phase concentration factors are computed in the average sense for each micro-constituent, and history data is updated at two points (reinforcement and matrix) in the microstructure, one for each phase. Macroscopic history data is stored in the database and then subjected in the post-processing stage onto the unit cell in the critical locations. For numerical examples considered, the CPU time obtained by means of the two-point averaging scheme with variational micro-history recovery with 30 seconds on SPARC 10/51 as opposed to 7 hours using classical mathematical homogenization theory. At the same time the maximum error in the microstress field in the critical unit cell was only 3.5% in comparison with the classical mathematical homogenization theory.},

The homogenization method is extended to such a framework and yields an efficient numerical algorithm for topology optimization. The main idea is to use a partial relaxation of the problem obtained by introducing special microstructures which are sequential laminated composites. Indeed, the so-called corrector terms of such microgeometries are ex- plicitly known, which allows us to compute the relaxed objective function. These correctors can be interpreted as stress amplification factors, caused by the underlying microstructure.},

abstract = {A gradient-enhanced computational homogenization procedure, that allows for the modelling of microstructural size effects, is proposed within a general non-linear framework. In this approach the macroscopic deformation gradient tensor and its gradient are imposed on a microstructural represen- tative volume element (RVE). This enables us to incorporate the microstructural size and to account for non-uniform macroscopic deformation fields within the microstructural cell. Every microstructural constituent is modelled as a classical continuum and the RVE problem is formulated in terms of standard equilibrium and boundary conditions. From the solution of the microstructural boundary value problem, the macroscopic stress tensor and the higher-order stress tensor are derived based on an extension of the Hill--Mandel condition. This automatically delivers the microstructurally based constitutive response of the higher-order macro continuum and deals with the microstructural size in a natural way. Several examples illustrate the approach, particularly the microstructural size effects.},
